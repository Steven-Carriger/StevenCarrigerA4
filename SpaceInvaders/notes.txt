Functionality: all functionality is implemented from what I can tell in the requirements.

Extra Functionality: Added extra functionality to where the enemy ships will move down after one iteration of moving right and left.

Bugs: no bugs found when I tested my code.

If having frame rate issues with the project, go to where the timer is created in the GameManager class on line 164 and change the number 55 to 75.

To change the rate at which the enemies may shoot bullets, go to the EnemyShipManager class in Manager Classes.
the default chance is a 0 out of a 0-99 range (because of nextInt being exclusive on the second parameter) as I found that to be the "sweet spot" 
in testing the code without too many bullets being fired.
